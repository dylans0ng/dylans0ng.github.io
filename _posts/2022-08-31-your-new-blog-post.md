## My SQL Progress Throughout the Summer

### Introduction
As summer comes to an end, I want to recount all the things that I've learned, specifically for a language called SQL. I started learning SQL in the beginning of the summer because, next to Excel, it is one of the most in-demand skills that are required to become a data scientist. I've been using this Udemy course called "The Complete SQL Bootcamp 2022: Go from Zero to Hero" that has helped me learn and practice the essential SQL concepts. I want to provide a quick summary, or cheat sheet, of what I've learned from the course so that you can refer to this post that could help you in the next query that you make!

Anyways, without furtherado, here is a recap of what I've learned about SQL:
