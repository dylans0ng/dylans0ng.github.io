# My First SQL Project: Data Science Salaries 

## Introduction
Hello everyone! This is my first SQL project on Postgres and I want to share this because it might be helpful for those of you that are learning the basics of SQL. I hope you read until the end to see what I accomplished!

## Project Topic
This project is about the salaries of different data science positions and I got the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruchi798/data-science-job-salaries) from Kaggle. If you want to play with the dataset yourself, I encourage you to check it out! 

## Statistical Questions
When doing a project, it is always important to have a goal in mind. That is why I created some questions to answer as I build queries:
- What is the average salary for the different data science job positions?
- Does being employed full-time make your salary higher?
- How does job experience level impact your salary?
