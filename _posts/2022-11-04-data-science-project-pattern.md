## Introduction
After doing a few SQL projects in the past, I realized that there is a pattern, or cycle if you will, when doing these kinds of projects. I wanna share this to anyone interested in data science because it is cruicial to understand how to approach a project if you want to improve your data analytical skills. 

I broke this pattern up into 3 broad categories and came up with a nice three letter acronym for it: **ACE**.

**A**SK QUESTIONS
  - If you want to learn and gain insights from a dataset, it is important that you ask questions. 
  - By asking yourself questions, you are creating a mental plan of what you want to do with the data.
  - Not asking any questions will not get you anywhere because you will just be staring blankly at the data without any goal in mind.

**C**LEAN DATA
  - 99% of the time the data for your project will be messy. What I mean by "messy" is that there could be many missing entries, null values, and data that is in an incorrect format. 
  - It is beneficial to remove any unncessary columns that **do not answer your questions**. If you have a specific goal that you want to achieve with the data, there's no point in keeping a column with data that is completely irrelevant. 

**E**XPLORE DATA
  - Conclusions
