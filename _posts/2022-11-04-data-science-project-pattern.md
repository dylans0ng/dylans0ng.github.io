## Introduction
After doing a few SQL projects in the past, I realized that there is a pattern when doing these kinds of projects. 

I broke it up into 3 broad categories and came up with a short acronym for it: **ACE**.

**A**SK QUESTIONS
  - If you want to learn and gain insights from a dataset, it is important that you ask questions. 
  - By asking yourself questions, you are creating a mental plan of what you want to do with the data.
  - Not asking any questions will not get you anywhere because you will just be staring blankly at the data without any goal in mind.

**C**LEAN DATA
  - Fdfs
