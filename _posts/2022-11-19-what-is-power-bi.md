## Introduction
Throughout this month, I've posted many projects that involved wrangling data through SQL. However, I am going to shift gears and start playing around with a data visualization tool called **Power BI**. 

Power BI is a great way to gain insights from your data as it is much easier to understand large amounts of numbers by **looking at visuals** rather than looking at rows and columns of data.
