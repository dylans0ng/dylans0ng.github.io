## Introduction
Throughout this month, I've posted many projects that involved wrangling data through SQL. However, I am going to shift gears and start playing around with a data visualization tool called Power BI. 

Power BI is a great way to gain insights from your data as it is much easier to understand large amounts of numbers by looking at visuals rather than looking at rows and columns of data. 

I've chosen to use Power BI because I love the GUI of the app, and it is very easy to learn; there are many free tutorials online that could get you started.
