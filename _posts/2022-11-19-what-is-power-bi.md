# What is Power BI? (UNFINISHED)

## Introduction
Throughout this month, I've posted many projects that involved wrangling data through SQL. However, I am going to shift gears and start playing around with a data visualization tool called **Power BI**. 

Power BI is a great way to gain insights from your data as it is much easier to understand large amounts of numbers by **looking at visuals** rather than looking at rows and columns of data. 

I've chosen to use Power BI because I love the GUI of the app, and it is very easy to learn; there are many free tutorials online that could get you started.

In this post, I'm going to walk through the **main features of the Power BI Desktop app**, so if you're interested in learning about the basics of this powerful data visualization tool, keep reading! 

## Workflow within Power BI Desktop
Power BI Desktop is the app that is free for anyone. You can many things with the free version such as **cleaning data, creating visuals, and managing relationships between tables**. However, the downside is that you cannot collaborate together with others and share your work to the public. To do that you must use a paid version called Power BI Pro.

I'm only going to be focusing on Power BI Desktop since anyone has access to it.

There are **3 main steps** when working inside Power BI Desktop:

1. **Query Editor** (Connect data/transform)
2. **Data Model** (manage relationships)
3. **Report** (make visuals)

I will explain the function of each step and how it looks like in the app.

## Query Editor
This is the first step in the workflow. You can't create any visuals if you do not have any connected data! Therefore, **you must know how to import your data**.

Once you open the Power BI Desktop, go to the "Home" button and **click on "Get Data"**. It looks like this:

There, you can import your data from various sources such as **Excel, SQL Server, Microsoft Access, and many more**. It's cool how Power BI can connect to data from so many different servers. 

After you click on the dataset that you want, you will see a pop-up appear on your screen. On the bottom of the pop-up, you will see three options "**Load**", "**Transform Data**", and "**Cancel**".

Even though the "Load" button may look more appearing, **don't click it**! You should click on "Transform Data" first because **you want to be able to clean your data** before you load it onto Power BI.

Once you click on "Transform Data", a new window will appear. This window is called the "**Query Editor**". It looks something like this:

Here, you can clean data by **removing null values, changing the format of the columns, etc**. 

After you're done with cleaning, you can click the "**Close & Apply**" button on the top left corner of the Query Editor and you're ready to move on to the next step!
