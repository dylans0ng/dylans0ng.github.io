## Introduction
I started learning Excel a few days ago, and I learned a cool thing you can do with it (credit to the Udemy course that I learned it from: [Microsoft Excel from Beginner to Advanced](https://www.udemy.com/course/microsoft-excel-2013-from-beginner-to-advanced-and-beyond/)). I want to share you this little tip in this quick blog post because it may be helpful for some of you Excel users. 

But first off, what even is Excel?

## What is Excel?
Excel is a spreadsheet program that was created by Microsoft. It organizes data into rows and columns, and you can **gain many insights from the data** by performing many different Excel functions in the formula bar. Excel is also a great program to **clean your data** because let's face it, most of the data that you get is going to be messy.

Cleaning data in Excel is a very tedious process, but there is something called the **Quick Access Toolbar** that can make your life a lot easier.

## Quick Access Toolbar
The Quick Access Toolbar is located in the **top left corner** of the Excel interface. 

It's very small but it is very useful because it provides **many shortcut buttons** for different kinds of features.

If you never customized your Quick Access Toolbar, then it probably looks like this:

You can use the **dropdown arrow** to the right to **add or remove** any shortcut buttons. You can also **add any common formulas** that you use into the Quick Access Toolbar so that **you don't have to constantly find it everytime** you're about to use it. 

Now, this is just personal preference, but I found it **more convenient** for me to have the "**Sum**" formula and the "**Sort ascending**" and "**Sort descending**" buttons in my toolbar because I use those formulas pretty often. So, here's what it looks like for me:

## Conclusion
That's it for this post, and I hope you found it useful! Thank you for reading and have a good day!
