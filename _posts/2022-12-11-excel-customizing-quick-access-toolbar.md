## Introduction
I started learning Excel a few days ago, and I learned a cool thing you can do with it (credit to the Udemy course that I learned it from: [Microsoft Excel from Beginner to Advanced](https://www.udemy.com/course/microsoft-excel-2013-from-beginner-to-advanced-and-beyond/)). I want to share you this little tip in this quick blog post because it may be helpful for some of you Excel users. 

But first off, what even is Excel?

## What is Excel?
Excel is a spreadsheet program that was created by Microsoft. It organizes data into rows and columns, and you can **gain many insights from the data** by performing many different Excel functions in the formula bar. Excel is also a great program to **clean your data** because let's face it, most of the data that you get is going to be messy.

Cleaning data in Excel is a very tedious process, but there is something called the **Quick Access Toolbar** that can make your life a lot easier.
