# What are Excel Functions?

## Introduction
Hello everyone! How are you guys doing? In this post, I'm gonna provide a brief overview of functions in Excel. 

Functions are basically **predefined formulas** that the nice people at Microsoft have created for us to use. 

They are very useful because you can perform many **different kinds of calculations** that will make cleaning the data **much more efficient**. 

## Excel Function Syntax
A function always starts with the **EQUALS SIGN**. From the most basic Excel function to the most advanced function that you can ever type in your whole life, it will always always always start with the equals sign.

Caption: Don't forget your equals sign!

After the equals sign comes the **FUNCTION NAME**. These are the predefined formulas. If you don't know any function names, then you can go to **"Formulas" ribbon** to see hundreds, if not thousands, of built-in formulas.
