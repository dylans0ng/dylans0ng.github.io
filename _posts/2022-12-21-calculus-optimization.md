## Introduction
Hello everyone, how are you all doing? In this post, I'm going to be going over one of the most important concepts in calculus: **optimization**. It's very useful because **optimization can be applied to many different real-life scenarios**.

For example, let's say you are the owner of a business and you want to **maximize the profit** that you make based on all the products you sell. Well to do this, you would have to use calculus! By the end of this post, you are going to know how to solve this kind of problem.

Not only are we going to learn how to find the maximum profit, but we will also learn how to find the **minimum cost**, the **maximum/minimum area**, the **maximum/minimum volume**, and much more! So whether you are studying for a test or you are just curious about what optimization is, then keep reading!

## Optimization: A Brief Overview
### What is Optimization?
Optimization is all about finding the **GLOBAL EXTREMA**. Global extrema refers to **global minimum** and **global maximum**. 

### Global Extrema

**Global minimum** = Lowest value in the function. 

**Global maximum** = Highest value in the function.

Keep in mind that global extrema represents the value of f(x), **NOT the x-value**. 

So, for example, you would say, "The function f(x) has a global minimum of 5 **AT X = 2**". You would **NOT** say "The function f(x) has a global minimum of 2".

### The EXTREME VALUE Theorem
If f is **continuous** on the closed interval a <= x <= b, then f has a **global maximum** and **globam minimum** on that interval. 

## Finding Global Extrema
### Critical Points using First Derivative 
In order to find global extrema, you must know how to find **critical points**. Critical points are where the **slope of the tangent line** is 0 OR undefined. 

To find the specific x-values of the critical points, we must find the first derivative of the function, **set it equal to 0**, and solve for x. We must ALSO **find x-values that make the first derivative undefined**.
