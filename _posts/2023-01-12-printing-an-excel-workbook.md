## Introduction
If you need to print out your Excel sheet on paper, you might notice that **some parts of your data can get cut off**, especially if you have massive amounts of data! In this post, I'm going to show you how you can print out your data so that **everything shows up on the paper cleanly**.

## Printer Margins
You probably know that to print anything you gotta do **Ctrl+P**. If you do this in Excel, it will give you a **preview of how the paper will be printed**.

For example, when I look at the preview for the sheet that I'm on, it looks like this:

Caption: Note: These numbers are not actually real 

You can see that **only part of a chart is showing up on the page**. To fix this issue, here's what you can do:
- First, click on this button

- Then, click on the button that says "**Custom Scaling Options**"
- This will open up a new window. From there, click on the "Margins" tab

- There, you can **change the inches** of the margins

However, there's **a better way** that I like to do to make the pages come out clean. 

## (My Preferred Method) Using Page Layout 
Personally, I like this method better because Excel zooms out so that you can **see all of your data in a bird's eye view,** which I think is kinda cool. 

If you want to see this kind of view, go to the "**View**" ribbon and then click on "**Page Layout**":

Here's what it should look like:

You can **drag each of the elements in your sheet** so that nothing will be cut off. For example, I moved the **bar chart to the second page** so that it won't get off on the first page. 

Now, if I look at the preview of how the page will turn out, nothing is cut off and it looks nice and clean:

You can see that this will **print out 2 pages**: one with the data and one with the chart.
