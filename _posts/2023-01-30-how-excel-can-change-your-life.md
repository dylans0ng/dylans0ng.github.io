That company will probably try to found out the **source of why less customers are buying its products**. However, to do that, they need **data**. A table of all the purchases will likely tell the company one of its new products has negative reviews and is lowering its reputation. As a result, the company will probably either get rid of the new product or make improvements on it. 

Tools such as Excel likely helped that company come to the conclusion because...

## Lays the foundation of learning other skills
