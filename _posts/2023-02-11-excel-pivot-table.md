You can **select the range of the table**. You can also just include the **table name** inside the range box. In my example, the table's name is called "YearlySales".

Click on "OK".

4) You will see a **blank pivot table** and on the right hand side, you will see a pane called "**PivotTable Fields**":

5) You can drag **whatever columns you want** into the different sections in the PivotTable Fields pane. You'll notice that as you drag in columns, your pivot table will **automatically update**!
