## Introduction
Hello everyone!

In this post, I will show you a quick feature called "**Freeze Panes**" tool in Excel. It is very useful if you want to **enter new data** in a large dataset.

## Freeze Panes
Consider this dataset:

Let's say that you want to enter more data in the "Buyer" column. This is a dataset that has quite a lot of rows, so I have to **scroll all the way down** to enter the data:

However, I might **forget what the column** that I am in actually represents, so I would have to **scroll all the way back up** to see the name of the column header. This can get pretty annoying, so there is a way to **fix this inconvenience**. It is a very easy problem to fix! 


First, go to the "**View**" ribbon and near the right side, there will be a button that says "**Freeze Panes**":

After you click on that, there will be a **dropdown menu**. Make sure to click on the one that says "Freeze **TOP ROW**":

This is because the column headers are **usually located on the first row**. So, by clicking on "Freeze Top Row" you will see that the column headers will **always be on the screen** even when you scroll all the way down:
