# LEFT() and RIGHT() Function

## Introduction
Hi everyone! I haven't posted in a while as I've been busy with school, but I'll try my best to post more often from here on out. In this post, I'll explain what the LEFT() and RIGHT() functions are. They are very easy to use and can be useful if you want to **split up a text** into two separate cells. 

## LEFT()
The LEFT() function returns the number of characters from **the left side** of the text string.

Consider this example:

Let's say I want to get my first name.

I know I can just type in "Dylan". But, **we shouldn't do things manually** because if we get a big dataset with hundreds of names, it's gonna be hard to manually type every single first name in. Luckily, we can use the LEFT() function.

Here's the syntax:
LEFT(**text**, **num_chars**)

"**text**" represents the text value. 

"**num_chars**" represents the number of characaters from the left of the string. 

So, since my first name is 5 characters long, we can do this:

... and bam! We got the first name:
