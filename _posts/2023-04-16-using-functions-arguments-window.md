# The Function Arguments Window in Excel

## Introduction
While memorizing the arguments for a function may seem helpful, you're going to deal with different kinds of formulas and there's no way someone has all the hundreds of functions in the back of their heads. 

Luckily, there's a tool in Excel that prevent us from having to rely on memorization: the **functions argument window**. 

## Where to Find it 
There's a button that looks like "fx" and it's to the **left of the formula bar**:

## When to Use it
You can use it whenever you are building a function. I like to use it all the time, but it's especially necessary for me when I forgot what the arguments were.

## How to use Make sure to put the = sign and type in the name of the function with the open parentheses
