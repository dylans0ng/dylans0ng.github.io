## Introduction
While memorizing the arguments for a function may seem helpful, you're going to deal with **different kinds of formulas** and there's no way someone has all the hundreds of functions in the back of their heads. 

Luckily, there's a tool in Excel that prevents us from having to rely on memorization: the **functions argument window**. Now this post is going to show you snippets of me demonstrating this simple feature, but if you want to see me do a **live walkthrough**, you can check out my **30-second video** here: https://tinyurl.com/4p2r7y6r

## Where to Find it 
There's a button that looks like "fx" and it's to the **left of the formula bar**:

## When to Use it
You can use it whenever you are **building a function**. I like to use it all the time, but it's especially necessary for me when I start using functions that are really complex.

## How to use It 
Make sure to put the **= sign** and type in the name of the function with the **open parentheses** and press the button:

This will open up a new pop-window that will show you **what each argument of the function does**:

## A More Complex Function
Now, AVERAGE() is one of the most basic functions, so here's an example of the function arguments window with a **more complex function**:
