## Introduction
Breaking Bad is one of the **top rated TV shows**, so I decided to make **a heatmap** that shows the IMDB ratings for each episode in the 5 seasons. 

In this post, I'll quickly show you how to **make this heatmap**, and you'll learn how to **create a matrix** and **apply color formatting** to the values inside the matrix. 

I'll be using Power BI to make this visual, but at the end of this post, I'll show you how you can **build the same thing in Excel**. 

## Where I got the Data
I did not make this dataset myself. Thank you so much to whoever compiled all the information on each Breaking Bad episode: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/varpit94/breaking-bad-tv-show-all-seasons-episodes-data

## Preparing the Data
Before I start making the visual, I need to clean up the data by getting rid of any unncessary columns. Now, when you import the data from your local computer onto Power BI, make sure to hit "**Transform Data**".

This will open up the **Power Query Editor**, which should look like this:

Here, we can **make changes** to our dataset. I'm going to get rid of ALL of the columns **except for the ones** called "Season", "Episode", and "Rating_IMDB".

To get rid of columns, right click the column name and hit **"Remove"**. You should see the step show up on the "Applied Steps" pane:

So, after you remove all the columns, you should be left with **3 columns**.

Now, hit **"Close and Apply"** on the top left corner:

We're ready to move on to the next step...

## Making the Heatmap
Before we do anything, make sure that you're in the "**Report**" tab that looks like this:
![image](https://github.com/dylans0ng/dylans0ng.github.io/assets/112503726/9705a6b8-1417-42fa-bf88-c0e85f24f4d2)

### Creating the Basic Matrix 
First, we need to make **a matrix** that will display all the IMDB ratings:
![image](https://github.com/dylans0ng/dylans0ng.github.io/assets/112503726/e936df43-703d-48d0-8e1a-177ebaede84a)

This will open a **blank matrix**:

Now, drag "Episode" from the data into the **rows of the matrix**, drag "Season" into the **columns of the matrix**, and drag "Rating_IMDB" into **the values of the matrix**:

This is what the result looks like so far:

### Styling the Matrix 
This is optional, but the numbers in the matrix look pretty ugly right now. You can make them **look cleaner** by changing the style to "Minimal": 
![image](https://github.com/dylans0ng/dylans0ng.github.io/assets/112503726/acd78bb0-36c1-4f4d-abb4-394260400b31)

Here's what you should get: 
![image](https://github.com/dylans0ng/dylans0ng.github.io/assets/112503726/b7301672-6181-4153-a3cb-5542c7e9b1bf)

The "Total" columns look pretty annoying, so let's remove that by toggling "**Column subtotals**" and "**Row subtotals**" off:
![image](https://github.com/dylans0ng/dylans0ng.github.io/assets/112503726/0612825f-6c42-4193-8c67-5791433d8d0e)

Now, the matrix looks a lot better!

### Adding Color 
This isn't a heatmap **until we add color** to it. To add a **color gradient** to this matrix, go to "**Cell elements**", and then toggle the "**Background color**" on, like this:

![image](https://github.com/dylans0ng/dylans0ng.github.io/assets/112503726/a897039e-c566-4f2a-a47a-441f5f247d66)

Here's what it looks like now:

![image](https://github.com/dylans0ng/dylans0ng.github.io/assets/112503726/4a0b2fd6-09dd-428b-8ef9-e4704e3e06b5)

But the **Breaking Bad color theme** isn't really blue. It's more of a **combination of yellow and green**, so that's what my color gradient is going to be.

To edit the color scheme, click on the button that says "fx":

Once you click that, you can fiddle around with the different colors. Here's the colors that I chose (you can use whatever colors you want!):

## The Final Result

... and that's what my final heatmap looks like. I hope you followed along with this blog post and drop down your heatmaps in the comments! I look forward to seeing them ðŸ˜„!

## Making this Breaking Bad Heatmap inside of Excel
You can also make a **Breaking Bad Heatmap in Excel** (it's slightly different than making it in Power BI)! If you want to learn how to do that, then check out this video: https://youtu.be/a-41Bxh-u3k
