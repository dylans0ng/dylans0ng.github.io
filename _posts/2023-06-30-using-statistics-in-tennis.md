# The Power of Data in Tennis
## Introduction
Being good at a sport isn't just about athleticism. Sure, having working muscles will give you an edge, but so will having a working brain ðŸ˜€. I strongly agree with the phrase "**Play smarter, not harder**".

In this short post, I'll specifically talk about tennis (because I love tennis!!!), and you'll see how **data can apply to one of the most popular sports**. It's pretty fascinating!  

## Players Can't Hide 
... and it's all because of technology.

In the past, it was really hard just to get footage of an opponent's practices and match plays. Now, the pros can just watch highlight reels on YouTube and **collect intel on their opponents**, so the next time they step on the court, they already have a **general idea of their opponents' strengths and weaknesses**. 

Not to mention, there's bound to be thousands of sites that'll pop up when you do a quick Google search of "(opponent name) weaknesses".

## Tennis Analytical Tools 
From this rise of technology, various tennis analytics services have appeared - both available to top tennis players and also fans like you and me. 

**IBM SlamTracker** collects millions of data points to analyze all the matchups that occur in the Grand Slam tournaments (Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, US Open). Here's an example for the 2022 US Open Finals:

There's also analytical companies like **Golden Set Analytics (GSA)** that provide data over a large number of matches for players of your choosing. Because its data is very reliable, Golden Set Analytics's services are pricey, so it's mainly used by professionals rather than recreational players. 

Here's a quick example:

And GSA's services have helped players like Djokovic reach the top 10 in the rankings. But they didn't analyze the complicated data visualizations themselves.

## Strategy Coaches 
A **strategy coach** named Craig O'Shannessy helped Djokovic get to number 1 with the use of data. On top of analyzing data visualizations, O'Shannessy analyzed videos of Djokovic's previous in-game points. Furthermore, he observed the types of shots that had a **higher winning percentage** for Djokovic and his opponents to find the best pattern of play.

## Conclusion
Other than training for hours on the court, tennis pros are **analyzing their own data from past tennis matches** to utilize their strengths and drill the ball towards their opponents' weaknesses. 

This'll **maximize their success** the next time they step on the court to face their rival.
