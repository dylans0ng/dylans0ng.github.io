# The Power of Data in Tennis
## Introduction
Being good at a sport isn't just about athleticism. Sure, having working muscles will give you an edge, but so will having a working brain ðŸ˜€. I strongly agree with the phrase "Play smarter, not harder".

In this short post, I'll specifically talk about tennis (because I love tennis!!!), and you'll see how data can apply to one of the most popular sports. It's pretty fascinating!  

## Players Can't Hide 
... and it's all because of technology.

In the past, it was really hard just to get footage of an opponent's practices and match plays. Now, the pros can just watch highlight reels on YouTube and collect intel on their opponents, so the next time they step on the court, they already have a general idea of their opponents' strengths and weaknesses. 

Not to mention, there's bound to be thousands of sites that'll pop up when you do a quick Google search of "(opponent name) weaknesses".

## Tennis Analytical Tools 
From this rise of technology, various tennis analytics services have appeared - both available to top tennis players and also fans like you and me. 

IBM SlamTracker collects millions of data points to analyze all the matchups that occur in the Grand Slam tournaments (Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, US Open). Here's an example for the 2022 US Open Finals:

There's also analytical firms like Golden Set Analytics blahblah
