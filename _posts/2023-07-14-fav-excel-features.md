# My Favorite Excel Feature: VBA! 
## Introduction
I love Excel because of its simplicity and its ability to efficiently organize data. In this post, I'm going to share my FAVORITE feature in Excel that ever data analysts should use.

## What is VBA?
VBA stands for Visual Basic for Applications, and it's available in all the Microsoft Office apps. It allows you to write code that'll automate repetitive tasks and save time. 

This is perfect for data analysts because they can implement VBA code to accomplish things such as easily formatting multiple workbooks with a single button press instead of manually changing each one. 

The good news is, if you have previous programming knowledge, learning VBA will be a lot easier since many of the concepts translate to other languages like Python or Java.
