## Introduction
It's much easier to gain insights by **looking at visuals**, rather than rows and columns of data. So, in this post, I'll share 3 visuals that you can make **using the Seaborn library**, which is provided by Python. 

## The Dataset 
As a demonstration, I'll be using a dataset on all the **pro tennis matches in 2022**. Here's the link, if you want to follow along: https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_atp/blob/master/atp_matches_2022.csv

## Importing the Libraries and Dataset in Python
In the first cell of our Jupyter notebook, we're going to import **3 libraries**: Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.

Pandas will allow us to **load our tennis dataset**, and Matplotlib is needed since **Seaborn is built on top of it**. 

To load the dataset with Pandas, we say this:

By running this line of code, we've created a Pandas dataframe called "**df**". The **.read_csv** method takes in the file name of the dataset, and it'll be different for you depending on **where you have saved it on your local machine**. 

Now, we are ready to create visuals from our dataframe, and it's quite simple!
