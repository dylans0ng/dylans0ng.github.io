## Introduction
In this post, I'll show you a **quick way** to show a list of **descriptive statistics** in Excel! And I'll be analyzing a **dataset on Big Mac prices** and use a **simple tool** to get the mean, median, and more. Here's the link to the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vittoriogiatti/bigmacprice

So, make sure to **read until the end** if you're interested to analyze this data in only a **couple of mouse clicks**! 

## The "Data Analysis" Feature
The "**Data Analysis**" feature is an Excel **add-in** that is very useful when it comes to **statistical summaries**. For this post, we'll use it to give us descriptive statistics of the Big Mac prices. 

However, if you're on the default Excel settings, then **you won't see the tool**. Here's how to enable it...

## Enabling "Data Analysis"
First, click on the "File" ribbon and then on the **bottom left hand corner**, click on "**Options**":

This will open a **new pop-up window** that looks like this:

From there, click on the **"Add-Ins**" section and then press "**Go**":

This will take you to another window, and you have to select the box that says "**Analysis ToolPak**":

After you do that, if you go to the "Data" ribbon back in the **Excel main interface**, you'll see a button that says "Data Analysis" in the **top right corner**:

So now, we're ready to get started and create the **list of descriptive statistics**!

## Using "Data Analysis"
If you click on the "Data Analysis" button, then Excel will show you a bunch of **analysis tools** that it'll **automatically** do for you:

I encourage you to explore the other tools, but in this post, I'm only going to focus on the "**Descriptive Statistics**" tool.

So if you select on that, then you'll see a new window where you have to provide **which columns or rows** you want to analyze:

Since I want to analyze the prices of the Big Macs, I'm gonna have to use the column that has all the **prices in the USD currency**, which is **column F** in this dataset. So, select on the **first cell** in column F and do **Ctrl+Shift+Down**:

Also, remember to leave the "**Grouped By**" option as "**Columns**", NOT "Rows":

And because the first cell is part of our input range, you have to **check** the "Labels in First Row" option:

Then, make sure that the "**Summary Statistics**" option is selected because that's the **type of output** Excel will give you:

If you want, you can choose **where** you want the descriptive stats to be located. You can either **specify the range of cells** or you can just create it in a **new worksheet**, which I'm gonna do.

So, I'll just call the new worksheet "**Big Mac Prices Stats**" and click on "OK":

## Analyzing "Data Analysis"
And that's really all it is! Once you do that, you'll see a new worksheet with the descriptive statistics on the **Big Mac prices column**:
