## Introduction
In this post, I'll show you how to create a **simple visualization** in Excel that you see above, and it'll only take a **couple steps**! It's basically a bar chart that's actually **INSIDE the cell**. 
And in the end, I'll provide you with a video that will provide a **more detailed walkthrough**, so make sure to keep reading till then!   

## Conditional Formatting to Add the Data Bar
So over here, I just have a simple table with all the months and the profits:

First, you have to **highlight** all the numbers and go to the **conditional formatting** tool:

What conditional formatting will do is take in all the numerical values and **automatically create data bars** based on what those values are.

So, after you click on that button, it's gonna open a menu. From that menu, click on **"Data Bars"** and select on the **color scales** that you like the best!

Personally, I prefer the **green color style**, so I selected that one.

From my screen, you can see that the **green bars** represent the months where we made a profit whereras the **red bars** represent months where we lost money. So, these data bars are a nice way of **quickly gaining insights** from your data. 

## Data Bar on a Separate Cell
But I wanna do one more thing. 

I don't like how the data bars are **overlapping with the numbers**. What I'm gonna do is move all these data bars onto a **separate column**. 

This will require a **couple more steps**, but it's still very easy to do! If you want to see me do this, then check out this **short video** that I made: INSERT THE LINK

I hope to see you over there, and thank you for reading this post!
