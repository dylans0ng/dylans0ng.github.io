# Web Scraping Wikipedia Data Using Pandas [3 Steps]

## Introduction
In this blog post, I'll show you how to w**eb scrape any data from Wikipedia** in Python. It's really easy to do and only requires **3 steps**! So, without wasting any more time, let's jump into it...

## Step 1: Import Libraries
First, you have to import the **Pandas** library:

Then, import the SSL library:

It's important to include the **last line of code** or else you **might get an error** saying that the certificate verification failed. 

After you import both these libraries, you're ready to move on to the next step...

## Step 2: Use the Read_html Method
The read_html method is provided by the Pandas library and will automatically **convert HTML tables into Pandas dataframes**, making it easy for us to analyze the web data in Python.
