# Create a TIMELINE SLICER for your Excel Dashboard!

## Intro
In this blog post, I'll show you how to create a **timeline slicer** in Excel. It's a pretty useful tool that will **make your dashboard more interactive**, especially if you have a timeline graph, because as you click on the different buttons on a timeline slicer, the **values on all your other visuals will change** based on the button you pressed. I'll explain more on this later, so keep reading!

## What is a timeline slicer?
A timeline slicer is a **filtering tool** lets you see values based on the **certain dates or times** that you filter on. You'll see how it works in this example I'm about to show you...

## Introducing the Dataset
To use the timeline slicer, I'm going to use a Kaggle dataset on **Netflix movies and TV shows** that you can find [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maso0dahmed/netflix-movies-and-shows).

Here's a quick glance at the data:

I formatted the **"release_year"** column as a date, which is going to be important for later. Also, I noticed that for some reason, **all the dates are inaccurate** because none of these movies and TV shows came out in 1905. They came out wayyy later. 

However, I'm still gonna work with it because the point of this blog post is to show you **HOW to create a timeline slicer**, and you can apply this process to **ANY other dataset**.

## Creating the Pivot Table
Before we create the timeline slicer, we have to first build a **simple pivot table**. So, click on the "Insert" ribbon and click on the **"Pivot Table"** button on the top left-hand corner:

Make sure that the **whole data** is selected inside the range and click on "OK":

Doing that's gonna create a new worksheet where you can **build the pivot table**.
