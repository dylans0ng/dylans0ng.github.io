## Intro
If you come across an article that contains data that you're interested in, then there's an easy way to **import that data** into Excel. Here's how to do it...

## Pasting in the URL
First, you have to go to the "Data" ribbon and click on **"From Web"**, which will show you something that looks like this:

All you have to do is **paste in the URL** of the website. In my case, I'll paste in a **Wikipedia article** that contains video game sales:

## Choosing the Right Table
After you click on "OK", you have to **choose the table** that contains the data that you're interested in. This is because Excel **sometimes detects other tables** from the website, so you have to make sure to select the right sheet by **looking at its preview**:

Since the preview for my data contains all the video game sales, I'm gonna click on **"Transform Data"** (do NOT click on "Load"!):

This will take you to the **Power Query Editor**, which is the tool where you **clean up** the data:

That's pretty much all it takes to **import data from a website** into Excel. If you want to learn how to **clean data** inside the Power Query Editor, then check out this 6 minute video:
