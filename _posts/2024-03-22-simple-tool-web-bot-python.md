# The Simple Tool to Build a Web Bot in Python
## Introduction
In this blog, I'll show you how to **automate** the process of **opening a website** in Python by following the steps I'm about to show you. At the end, I'll provide you with a short video that will walk you through all the steps. The best thing about this is that it's really easy to do and only requires a few lines of code!

## Importing the Selenium Library
Selenium is a library that lets your Python program interact with the web browser. To import this library, here's what you have to type:

I'm also going to import another library called **"webdriver_manager"**:

You'll see why I import this library in the next part.

## Opening Google Chrome
I'm going to create a variable called **"driver"**:

This will install the **ChromeDriverManager**, which will allow the Python program to **open a Google Chrome browser**. Now, we have to tell Python what to do with Chrome.

In this example, I'm going to try to let Python open up the main **Wikipedia** page on Google Chrome. So, I need to **copy the URL** of Wikipedia and paste it inside the **"get"** method:
