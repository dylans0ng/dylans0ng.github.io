## Introduction
Hello everyone! In this short post, I will talk about how you can create charts in Excel. 

Charts are a great way to take in a bunch of numbers and display them in a graphical format. It's **easier to understand data when you look at a simple visual** than when you look at messy data. 

## Know What You Want to Show
Before I jump into what you have to do, I wanna tell you that you **should not blindly create visuals** in the dashboard. You should **know what you want to show** in your visuals that you create, and they should answer your own **statistical questions**. Every visual should have a purpose.

## Creating a Chart
Okay, now I'll show you how to create a chart. It's quite straightforward because Excel makes it pretty easy. 

**Here are the steps:**
1) Click on the "Insert" ribbon.

2) **Highlight the data** that you want to show. Here's an example:

3) After you highlight the data, click on the **type of chart** that you want by going here:

You can click on each of the icons to see the different kinds of charts that Excel provides.

It's important to understand that **using a certain type of chart will not look good** depending on your data. For example, **pie charts do not work well with large amounts of data** because it will get very cluttered and **won't be helpful** in gaining insights. You must choose a type of visual that will display your data in a way that is **easy to understand** and is **visually appealing**. 

4) You can also change the data that you want within the chart by going to "chart design" and clicking FINISH THIS LATERRRR!
