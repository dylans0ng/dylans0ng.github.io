# Make a Breaking Bad Heatmap in Power BI

make a table of contents that shows each section with the end result 

notes:
when you import your data, make sure to click "transform data" instead of "load"
get rid of all the columns except for season, episode, and IMDB ratings. this is because I'm making a heatmap only on the IMDB ratings based on seasons and episodes, so anything else is unnecessary info.
